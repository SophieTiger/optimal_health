## Bugs
-   There was a bug causing error on the css file when the Google fonts where imported with the @import link. 
I reached out to Tutor support that helped me and advised to use the link to add in the html file instead which solved the issue. Though they could not really tell why that was happening.
### Unfixed bugs
-   No unfixed bugs

## Deployment
-   The site was deployed to Github pages as follows:
    -   In the Github repository, I navigated to Settings tab
